# RedDefineBot
**Python** with **PRAW**

**PRAW** is a **Python module** which is the near universal choice among botmakers for interacting with the Reddit API.

Basic reddit bot made by me.

- Replies to anyone in r/India who posts **'thanks modi'** with **'you are welcome saar'**
- Just like the famous bot of reddit, Thanks Obama - you're welcome
- Simple and fun. thank you.
